# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

In this report, the performance of machine learning models for credit risk classification is tested. The purpose of this analysis is to develop a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers based on historical lending activity data. The aim is to distinguish between healthy loans (0) and high-risk loans (1), where 0 indicates loans with a low risk of default, and 1 indicates loans with a high risk of default.

We conducted the analysis in the following stages:

1. **Data Preparation:** loaded the lending_data.csv dataset, created labels (y) from the "loan_status" column, and created features (X) from the remaining columns.

2. **Model Building:** employed a Logistic Regression model to make predictions on credit risk. Then, fitted the model with the original data and later with resampled data to address class imbalance using RandomOverSampler.

3. **Model Evaluation:** evaluated the model's performance through the generation of confusion matrices and classification reports, and  calculated balanced accuracy, precision, and recall scores.

## Results

### Original Data Model

- **Balanced Accuracy Score:** 0.9520
- **Confusion Matrix:**
  - True Negatives (0): 18663
  - False Positives: 102
  - True Positives (1): 563
  - False Negatives: 56
- **Classification Report:**
  - Precision (0): 1.00
  - Precision (1): 0.85
  - Recall (0): 0.99
  - Recall (1): 0.91

### Resampled Data Model

- **Balanced Accuracy Score (Resampled Model):** 0.9937
- **Confusion Matrix (Resampled Model):**
  - True Negatives (0): 18649
  - False Positives: 116
  - True Positives (1): 615
  - False Negatives: 4
- **Classification Report (Resampled Model):**
  - Precision (0): 1.00
  - Precision (1): 0.84
  - Recall (0): 0.99
  - Recall (1): 0.99

## Summary

The machine learning models exhibit strong performance. In the original data model a balanced accuracy score of 0.9520 indicated good predictive power for both healthy and high-risk loans. However, in the resampled data model, the balanced accuracy score improved significantly to 0.9937, demonstrating exceptional performance for identifying both types of loans.

The resampled model has a superior performance. It provides high accuracy and minimizes the risk of misclassifying high-risk loans. The improved recall score for high-risk loans (1) in the resampled model is particularly valuable for a lending service as it ensures that a larger proportion of high-risk loans is correctly identified, reducing potential losses.
